## About the Project

Webley is a modern, lightweight web framework for Python. It makes building web applications less complex by providing a minimalistic, yet powerful foundation for web development.

### Why Webley

Developing web applications in Python often involves juggling multiple libraries, boilerplates, and frameworks. Many solutions can feel overly complex or fragmented, requiring extra work to implement anything beyond basic functionality. Rather than just patching together multiple tools, Webley provides a cohesive, lightweight framework that gives you everything you need to build web applications efficiently.
